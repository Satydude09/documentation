        <P>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
          JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.JavaScript is easy to learn.
          This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
          programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
        <ul>
          <li>1. HTML to define the content of web pagesbr</li>
          <li>2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>
          <li> 3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <header>What you should already know</header>
        <p>
          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
          naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
          object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
          declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
          implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <P>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

      </section>
      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <P>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
          characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <P>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or
          underscore characters.</p>
        <code>
          const PI = 3.14;
        </code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
        <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
          WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          //statements }</code>
        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
        <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
          "otherValue";</code>
      </section>
      <section id="Datatypes" class="main-section">
        <header>Datatypes</header>
        <P>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
          <li class="li-itms">Boolean. true and false.</li>
          <li class="li-itms">null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
          <li class="li-itms">undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
            Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
          <li class="li-itms">String. "Howdy"</li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <P>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named
          containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="If-else" class="main-section">
        <header>If else</header>
        <P>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1
          and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
        <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
          statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
          statement_last; }</code>
        <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use
          block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
        <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </section>
      <section id="While-statement" class="main-section">
        <header>While statement</header>
        <P>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code>while (condition) statement</code>
        <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the
          statement following while.</p>
        <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
